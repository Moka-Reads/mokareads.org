## What is MoKa Reads?

MoKa Reads is an organization that develops open-source projects and research/publications.
We hope to be able to provide a platform for educational publications and research to be accessible
under an opensource-like nature and develop open-source projects to apply some our research.

## Our Mission?

MoKa Reads is founded by Mustafif Khan, who's an independent author/publisher, financial mathematician,
and open-source developer. His first published book was "Rust for C++ Programmers" and now wants
to provide a platform which places publications and research papers under opensource licenses, and
help build something amazing, and help others to learn it.

- We hope to provide a platform for open publications and research.
- We hope to provide a platform for open-source projects to be developed and maintained.
