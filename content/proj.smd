## Mufi-Lang

Mufi-Lang is a general-purpose, dynamic object-oriented toy language using a bytecode compiler
and features a standard library, alongside being built under the Zig build system.
This allows for better memory safety, error handling, cross compatibility, and easier development.

- Mufi-Lang aims to be a general-purpose language but with a focus on mathematical applications.
- Mufi-Lang is experimental and is not meant to be used in production.
- We hope to release research papers based on different ways we can improve the language, and
things that can be implemented.
    - For example research in efficient Matrix data structure could then be implemented in
    the language and benefit from the research.

## TexCreate

># [No Longer Maintained]($block.attrs('warning'))
> This project no longer is maintained

TexCreate is a LaTeX project creator that utilizes prebuilt templates to allow developers to easily create projects for various cases.
This is aimed towards developers/students who would like to have an easier time with development on LaTeX.

- TexCreate is my first major project and started back in 2021, and for a long time been a tool
I would regularly use.
- TexCreate is no longer being maintained, but still exists as a tool for users to use.
- Now I use Typst for my publications and papers.

## QuickFetch

QuickFetch is a library built to handle multiple requests within a Client (reqwest client which will handle it all under a Client Pool) ,
cache the response results, and handle these asynchronously.

The goal is to be a one-stop shop for handling local package manager development to handle multiple packages with a local cache
to easily update, get and remove the different responses.

- QuickFetch is experimental and is not meant to be used in production.
- QuickFetch is built under the Rust programming language and uses the reqwest library for handling requests.
