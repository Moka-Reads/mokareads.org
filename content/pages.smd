## Current Research

### Optimizing Pricing Strategy with Royalty Constraints
**Mustafif Khan**
*Status: In Progress • Expected 2025*

This research develops a comprehensive nonlinear optimization framework for determining optimal pricing strategies in multi-platform publishing environments with complex royalty structures. The work addresses the challenge of simultaneous pricing across multiple distribution channels while respecting platform-specific royalty constraints.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Nonlinear optimization problem formulation for pricing strategy
- Implementation using Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP)
- Trust-Region Constrained optimization methods
- Transparent, data-driven pricing methodology for digital and print platforms
