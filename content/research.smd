> Research papers will only be available for purchase on the MoKa Reads Shop under a pay-what-you-want model
> with a minimum amount being the cost of a cup of espresso...$5.00 CAD.

### Optimal Pricing Strategy

Our pricing under these multiple platforms and their various royalty amounts, we prepare a nonlinear optimization
problem to maximize the royalty per unit in a platform that comes to the cheapest to the reader.

- Read our [summary](https://github.com/Moka-Reads/optimizing-pricing/releases/download/v1/Platform_Royalties_Summary.pdf)
- Read our [problem write up](https://github.com/Moka-Reads/optimizing-pricing/releases/download/v1/problem.pdf)
- Visit our [Github repo](https://github.com/Moka-Reads/optimizing-pricing)

The goal of this problem is to promote transparency over how our publication prices are determined, and under our summary
we provide the listed MSRPs of our publications per platform under CAD.

## Current Research

We will have more information on our current research projects soon. Stay tuned!
